### Ingredients

* 1 lb refrigerated lo mein noodles
* 2 tablespoon unsalted butter
* 12-15 cloves garlic minced
* 2 teaspoon oyster sauce
* 2 teaspoon soy sauce
* 2 teaspoon fish sauce
* 1 teaspoon white granulated sugar
* 1Â½ tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese
* 1-2 green onion sliced and chopped
* Salt and pepper to taste

### Steps

1. In a small bowl, whisk together oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, and sugar. Set aside.
2. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Have it boiling and ready while you continue cooking.
3. In a large skillet or wok, melt butter over medium heat. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant, stirring often. Make sure to not brown the garlic, you just want it lightly cooked.
4. Drop the noodles into the boiling water. Lightly agitate the noodles to separate them but don't overwork and break them. Boil for 30 seconds maximum, then use tongs to quickly transfer the noodles to the garlic butter.
5. Give the sauce in the bowl a whisk and pour onto the noodles, making sure to get all the sugar. Lightly season the noodles with salt and pepper, then toss and stir to evenly coat the noodles in the sauce.
6. Turn off the heat. Add the Parmesan cheese and green onion. Toss to combine and season to taste.
