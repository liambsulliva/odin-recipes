### What you might not know about unicycles

Unicycles aren’t just for the circus:

- probably not the fastest for your daily commute, but unicycles were originally used a mode of transport
- great way for many to stay fit, with lower impact on joints than running, for example
- unicycle basketball and unicycle hockey are both actually a thing
Wrapping up
That’s all for this part of the Astro Beginners’ tutorial. We have the foundations in place for our blog site. We took a first look at Astro Collections and created a blog post template using getStaticPaths. Now you can add more blog post pages to the site just by creating new Markdown files in src/content/blog. You will explore Astro Content Collections a little more in the next lesson. Right now, we have to type the post URLs manually; not ideal for user experience. We will add a list of posts next, to address this. See you there!
